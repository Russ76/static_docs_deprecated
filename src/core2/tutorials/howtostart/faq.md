# FAQ #


**My Raspberry Pi 3 does not provide the 'Husarion Config XXXX' Wi-Fi network and I can't connect it to the Husarion Cloud.**

Make sure that you are not using the external USB Wi-Fi dongle. Raspberry Pi 3 has the Wi-Fi on board and this version can't be used with external Wi-Fi card at this moment.

**I have RoboCORE and it doesn't work correctly with Husarion Cloud. What can I do?**

Try to remove RoboCORE app and download again the newest version from Google Play, then try again.

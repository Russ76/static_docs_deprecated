# How to add a camera to your robot #
## CORE2 + smartphone/tablet ##
Your robot with CORE2 can use a camera that is built into a smartphone or a tablet. The video from camera can be viewed in the robot's user interface. Currently this feature is available only for Android devices.

At first, your CORE2 needs to be connected to your account on [cloud.husarion.com](https://cloud.husarion.com/).

Install the [hVideo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.husarion.video2&hl=en) app on your smartphone or tablet. Enable Wi-Fi or mobile data transmission on the device.

Login to the Husarion Cloud, find your robot, click <img src="/assets/img/howToStart/plus.png"/> and "Add camera".

Click "Generate new QR code". 

Launch the hVideo app on your smartphone, choose the "Pair with robot" option in the hVideo menu, and scan the QR code displayed at Husarion Cloud with your smartphone.
